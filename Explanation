    Basically to make a object orbitate/spin you add one object to another like a parent-child relation
and when the parent rotates/translates, its child will also move around, but at the same speed as of its
parent. So we make all planets bound to Object3D, and make'em rotate at its own speed around the sun.

    Since the sun is the light source, we make a point lighter that imits light in all directions.
