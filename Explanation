Creating object when mouse-click AND ADDING PHYSICS TO THE BALLS

1 - create an invisible plane facing directly the camera, every time mouse move is detected
(vector, originPoint) -> (normalVector, pointClickRayCaster)


since we create the balls dynamics there's no way to pass the mesh and the body to the animate function.
So we use 2 array to store that info and pass it for the function meshes[0] and bodies[0] references the same ball.


The position of the ballBody will be the position of the click

Also their colors will be random
