Cannon.js is a js library to simulate real world physics (gravity,inercia,friction,collision)


1 - Creation of a physics world (Cannon.js)
2 - Creation of a mesh, visual entity (Three.js)
3 - Creation of a transparent entity, body, affect by the physics fenomenun (Cannon.js)
4 - Merge mesh with the body

{[(1)]}
npm install cannon-es

OBS
He rotates the plane with CANNON because it's a physical body and the mesh copies the body's translation and rotation

The shape of the body needs to be half of the shape of the mesh
example: 
    const groundGeo = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(30, 30);
    shape: new CANNON.Box(new CANNON.Vec3(15,15,0.1))

To simulate collision, CANNON.js has a built-in material for objects
CANNON: how body react when collision
THREE: Visual, provides the local of an object
